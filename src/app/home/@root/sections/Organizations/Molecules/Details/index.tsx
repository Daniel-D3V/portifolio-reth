                As a pivotal part of the talented team at Warp Store, I'm fully immersed 
                in the realm of modern development. Leveraging Docker, clean architecture, and DDD principles, 
                I'm crafting solutions that stand the test of time. My toolkit includes Node.js and TypeScript, 
                and I ensure the security of the APIs I develop, prioritizing the protection of user data and 
                system integrity.
